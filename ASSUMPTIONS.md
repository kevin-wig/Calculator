# Assumptions

## Calculator UI

### UI Referencing
I referenced the UI of WIN 10 calculator but not the same.

### History UI
I simply made history UI on the right of the main panel of calculator.

### Expression Inputting
You can input expressions with only buttons on the UI.
Meaning that you cannot input expression with desktop keyboard,
because the expression can be generated messily.
In other words I validated the expression primarily on inputting.

### Validation for trigonometric operators
I accepted the expression like `sin50` as `sin(50)`.
I think it would be valid for normal expression and there is no part mentioned about that in requirement.
So I just followed my thinking.
