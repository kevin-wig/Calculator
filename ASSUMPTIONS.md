# Assumptions

## Calculator UI

### UI Referencing
I referenced the UI of WIN 10 calculator but not the same.

### History UI
I simply made history UI on the right of the main panel of calculator.

### Expression Inputting
You can input expressions with buttons on the UI and also with Keyboard.
And for the `sin`, `cos`, `tan` operators you can input as following
```
    press "s" key for sin
    press "c" key for cos
    press "t" key for tan
```
### Validation for trigonometric operators
I accepted the expression like `sin50` as `sin(50)`.
I think it would be valid for normal expression and there is no part mentioned about that in requirement.
So I just followed my thinking.
